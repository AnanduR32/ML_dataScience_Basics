% Initialize matrix A and B 
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 6, 7]
B = [8, 9, 10; 11, 12, 13]

% Initialize constant s 
s = 10

% See how element-wise addition works
add_AB = A + B 

% See how element-wise subtraction works
sub_AB = A - B

% See how scalar multiplication works
mult_As = A * s

% Divide A by s
div_As = A / s

% What happens if we have a Matrix + scalar?
add_As = A + s
