% The ; denotes we are going back to a new row.

% Initialize a vector 
fprintf "Vector :\n"

% Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns
fprintf "Dimenton \nm - row :\nn - column :\n"

% You could also store it this way
fprintf "vector :"

% Get the dimension of the vector v 
fprintf "Dimension of vector v :\n"

% Now let's index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A
A_23 = A(2,3)

% Transpose A 
A_trans = A' 

% Take the inverse of A 
A_inv = inv(A)

% A^(-1)*A gives corresponding identity matrix 
A_invA = inv(A)*A
