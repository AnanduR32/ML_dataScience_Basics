# Basics
* setting current working directory - 
    ````
    setwd("</PATH TO WORKING DIRECTORY/>")
    ````
    Where setwd - set working directory
* executing an R program : 
    `````
    source("</PATH TO FILE.R/>",echo = TRUE)
    ````
* Commenting multiple lines ( comment symbol - '#')
    ````
    ctrl + shift + C
    ````
* Clear Console Window 
    ````
    ctrl + L
    ````
* Clearing the environment 
    ````
    rm(variable) // To remove a particular variable 
    ````
    ````
    rm(list=ls()) // ls() function lists all the variables and stores it in list, the -rm function then one by one remove each variable in the list
    ````

* Datatypes in R
    * Logical, Integer, Numeric, Complex, Character
    * To find datatype of a variable :
        * typeof(variable)
    * To verify is variable is of certain datatype
        * is.datatype(object) 
            eg: 
            ```` 
             is.integer(array_of_numbers)
    * To convert datatype to/as a specified one 
        * as.datatype(object) 
            eg: 
            ```` 
            as.logical(binary_array)
* Basic Objects in R
    * Vector, List, Dataframe 
    * Vector : an ordered collection of basic data types of given length
        * All the elements of a vector must be of same data type
        * eg : 
            ````
            X = c(2.3,2.6,3.5)
    * List : a generic object consisting of an ordered collection of objects
        * A list could consist of a numeric vector, a logical value, a matrix, a complex vector, a character array, a function, and so on
        * eg : 
            ````
