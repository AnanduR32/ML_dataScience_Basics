# Basics
* setting current working directory - 
    ````
    setwd("</PATH TO WORKING DIRECTORY/>")
    ````
    Where setwd - set working directory
* executing an R program : 
    `````
    source("</PATH TO FILE.R/>",echo = TRUE)
* Commenting multiple lines ( comment symbol - '#')
    ````
    ctrl + shift + C
    ````
* Clear Console Window 
    ````
    ctrl + L
    ````
* Clearing the environment 
    ````
    rm(variable) // To remove a particular variable 
    ````
    ````
    rm(list=ls()) // ls() function lists all the variables and stores it in list, the -rm function then one by one remove each variable in the list

* Datatypes in R
    * Logical, Integer, Numeric, Complex, Character
    * To find datatype of a variable :
        * typeof(variable)
    * To verify is variable is of certain datatype
        * is.datatype(object) 
            eg: 
            ```` 
             is.integer(array_of_numbers)
    * To convert datatype to/as a specified one 
        * as.datatype(object) 
            eg: 
            ```` 
            as.logical(binary_array)
* Basic Objects in R
    * Vector, List, Dataframe 
    * Vector : an ordered collection of basic data types of given length
        * All the elements of a vector must be of same data type
        * eg : 
            ````
            X = c(2.3,2.6,3.5)
    * List : a generic object consisting of an ordered collection of objects
        * A list could consist of a numeric vector, a logical value, a matrix, a complex vector, a character array, a function, and so on
        * eg : 
            If
            ````
            ID = c(1,2,3,4)
            emp.name = c("Arun","Anil","Adil","Amar")
            num.emp = 4
            ````
            Then we can make a list of objects ID, emp.name and num.emp using the list() function as 
            ````
            emp.list = list(ID, emp.name, num.emp)
            print(emp.list) 
            
            ````
            Output : 
            ````
            [[1]]
            [1] 1 2 3 4
            
            [[2]]
            [1] "Arun" "Anil" "Adil" "Amar"
            
            [[3]]
            [1] 4 
            ````
        * Accessing Elements of a list 
            List item by specifying it within [[item]] and followed by a [instance] to access a list items' instance
            eg :
            ````
                print(emp.list[[1]][1])      
            ````
            output : 
            ````            
                1
            ````
        * Manipulating components can be done by simply accessing the component and modifying their values 
        * Concatenation of lists 
            ````
            emp.ages = list("ages" = c(24,23,12,54))
            emp.list = list(emp.list,emp.ages)
            ````
    * Dataframes 
        * Data frames are generic data objects of R, used to store tabular data
        * Syntax : 
            ````
            df = data.frame(vec1,vec2,vec3)
            ````
        * Reading dataframes from file 
            ````
            newDF = read.table(path=“Path of the file”)
            ````
        * Accessing rows/columns 
            * To access first two rows
            ````
            df[1:2,] 
            ````
            * To access first two columns 
            ````
            df[,1:2] or df[1:2]
            ````
        * Editing dataframes 
            * Method 1 : Similar to how lists are edited using [[]] to represent item and [] for that items' instance 
            * Using the edit() function 
            * To add rows, use 
              ````
              rbind(dataframe1, dataframe2) 
              ````
              here dataframe2 represents as many vectors as there are columns in dataframe1 
            * To add columns, use
              ```` 
              cbind(dataframe1, dataframe2)
              ````
              here dataframe2 has complete vector(s) with as many elements as there are rows in dataframe1
            * Deletion
              * Unconditional delete - specified selecting the row/column to be deleted a specifying '-' before their index value 
                ````
                df2 = df1[-3,-1] 
                ````
              here, the row 3 and column 1 will be removed from df1 and result stored in df2
              * conditional delete - selecting only necessary components of a dataframe and storing it
                ````
                df2 = df1[ , !names(df) %in% c("vec3")] 
                ````
                stores all columns(vectors) in df1 to df2 unless the column name is "vec3"
              * When manipulating string fields in a dataframes factoring problem can occur to avoid it set 'stringsAsFactors = F' during dataframe creation, as a parameter within the data.frame() function
